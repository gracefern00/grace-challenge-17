## social-media-api

## Description
This project is a backend API for a social network application built using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM. It allows users to create accounts, share thoughts, react to othersâ€™ thoughts, and manage a list of friends, all through RESTful API routes tested in Insomnia. The design focuses on handling unstructured data efficiently and demonstrates core CRUD operations, data modeling, and relationships in a NoSQL database environment.
